# MS-Capstone--Stanford-XRay-Anomaly-Detection-Competition

The following files are a combination of code, research and write ups of my Capstone project for a Masters of Science in Business Analytics.

Breakdown:
        --The goal is to complete a previous Stanford Data Challenge (Event had already concluded prior to our submission, this was purely for compeletion purposes).
        --XRAY anomaly detection; Broken/Non Broken Bones and their locations.
        --The Framework used is a Python 3.x environment with TensorFlow 2.x structure.
        --A team of 4 was created, however, my main role was designing,engineering and building the deep learning model of binary base output on if a bone was broken or not (1 or          0) with predictions running in a fitting model and history.
Note* The files in this repo are a combination of work and will not run entirely in any 1 file. The primary file - Stanford-Anomaly-Detection - will need to be ran and the other files are variation of models for predictions
